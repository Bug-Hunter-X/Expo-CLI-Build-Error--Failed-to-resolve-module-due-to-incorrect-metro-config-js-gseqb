While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `metro-config` module. The error message was quite generic, stating something like 'Failed to resolve module', but didn't pinpoint the exact issue. After considerable debugging, it turned out to be an incorrect path specified in the `resolver.sourceExts` array within my `metro.config.js` file. The path contained a typo or pointed to a non-existent directory.
